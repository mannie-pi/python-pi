# Basic Circuit to run Motor using Python With a Raspberry Pi (40 pin)

In this demonstration, we will go over how to connect a motor to Raspberry-Pi (40 pin) and start it for 10 seconds and stop it. The purpose of this function is to remotely be able to turn on or off a motor run device, for ex. turn on the fan or garage door.

Requirements:
* Raspberry-Pi installed with Raspian: Below is version for my Raspian. 


```
$cat /etc/os-release
```

```
PRETTY_NAME="Raspbian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)"
NAME="Raspbian GNU/Linux"
VERSION_ID="9"
VERSION="9 (stretch)"
ID=raspbian
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="http://www.raspbian.org/"
SUPPORT_URL="http://www.raspbian.org/RaspbianForums"
BUG_REPORT_URL="http://www.raspbian.org/RaspbianBugs"
```
* Python installed: Below is version of python i used

```
$python --version
```

```
Python 2.7.13
```
 
* Breadboard for connections to be made on


* An L293D motor driver chip


* Cables to connect things up


* DC motor (I used 3v and 5v DC motors)


* 2 AA Batteries


* AA Battery Connector

## How to read the Pin numbers on Raspberry-Pi and L293D Chip
### Reading Pin numbers on Raspberry-Pi 
Below is a image that shows the pin numbers of Raspberry-Pi. 
![alt text](../../images/gpio-pins.png)

* The numbers inside the RED box is the PIN Numbers which can be used in BOARD mode.
 
```
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
```
* The numbers outside the RED box, for example GPIO2 or GPIO14 or GPIOx are the denotion to be used in BCM Mode. In past, these have changed with version of Raspberry Pi, so i try to use BOARD mode when possible. 

```
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
```

### Reading Pin numbers on L293D Chip
I have gone through multiple articles and demonstrations and the pin numbers seemed to be off when connecting it between sites. So, I have created my reference in the below image. I am using this reference for the circuit. The marker in the image is indicating where i started with. (If they are inaccurate, pardon me.) 

In some articles, i read we could reference the circle on the aligned to one side (Not the big one in the center of one side). So, we could use the small circle aligned to one side and go to the bottom of that side and that would be the Pin-number 1.

## Beginning the connections between Raspberry Pi and L293D Chip 
This should be done when Raspberry Pi is powered off to avoid any short circuits on accident.

Color Codes for cables: 
* Red: Power from PI 
* Black: Ground 
* Green: Pi PIN 36 
* Yellow: Pi PIN 38
* Orange: Pi PIN 40
* White: Connection from L293D to Motor. PIN 3 and PIN 6 of L293D to Motor.
* Blue: Batter to L293D PIN 9

* Connect Power-in
    * Raspberry Pi PIN 2 to L293D PIN 1
* Connect Ground
    * We are using Raspberry Pi PIN 3
    * We are connecting ground on breadboard to the vertical connections, so we dont have to use multiple ground pins on the Pi. Instead, we could use the vertical connections. As shown in the screenshot, if the Ground is connected as shown in __1__, the whole vertical line is ground now. 
    
  Picture for above two connections are below:

* For easy access to the ground on the other side of breadboard, we connect the vertical line with vertical line on other side as shown in below image.


* Continue on Grounds for L293D, below are the PINS on L293D which need to be grounded.
    * PIN 4, 5 
    * PIN 12, 13 
    
  ![alt text](../../images/ground-L293D.jpeg)

* Connect Pi's GPIO to L293D 
    * Pi PIN 36 to L293D PIN 2
    * Pi PIN 38 to L293D PIN 7
    * Pi PIN 40 to L293D PIN 8
  
  Shown in below image: 
  
  ![alt text](../../images/GPIOToL293D.jpeg)

* Connect Power using AA Battery to L293D Chip
    * Connect the PIN 9 of Chip with one of the vertical connections.
    * Connect the Batteries's Positive to the vertical connection same as PIN 9's.
    * Connect the Batteries's ground to ground vertical connection. 
  
* Connect Motor with L293D Chip
    * Connect the motor with PIN 3 and PIN 6 of L293D
  
  Above 2 connections are shown in below image:
  
  ![alt text](../../images/motor-battery-1.jpeg)
  
* Connections are all done. 


* Power up the Raspberry Pi


* Go to the directory and Run the code as: 

```
$python motor-basic.py
```

  The output on terminal should be like below: 

```
$python motor-basic.py
Turning motor on
```
 
  The motor should be running and it would run for 10 seconds and then stop.
  Final output on the terminal would be:
  
```
$python motor-basic.py
Turning motor on
Stopping motor
$
```

That's it. We got the motor running.
